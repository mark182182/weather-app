This application shows the current weather for the given location. 
You can set the radius and the number of displayed rows.

I created this app to learn more about async functions, chaining together API calls, React Hooks and separating the different layers (services, presentational components, etc.).

Todo:
  - Write tests
  - Auto deploy to Firebase with Travis-CI

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
