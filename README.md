This application shows the current weather for the given location.

 I created this app to learn more about async functions, chaining together API calls, React Hooks and separating the different layers (services, presentational components, etc.). It was also a useful experience to deepen my knowledge of testing using Jest and Enyzme.

It also features automated testing and deployment to Firebase with Circle-CI.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
